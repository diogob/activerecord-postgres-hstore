h2. Goodbye serialize, hello hstore.

You need dynamic columns in your tables. What do you do?

 * Create lots of tables to handle it.
   Nice, now you'll need more models and lots of additional sqls. Insertion and selection will be slow as hell.

 * Use a noSQL database just for this issue.
   Good luck.

 * Create a serialized column.
   Nice, insertion will be fine, and reading data from a record too. But, what if you have a condition in your select that includes serialized data? Yeah, regular expressions.

h2. Requirements

Postgresql 8.4+ (also tested with 9.0) with contrib and Rails 3. (It might work on 2.3.x with minor patches...)
On Ubuntu, this is easy: @sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib-9.0@

On Mac <del>...you are screwed. Use a VM.</del> you should use "the binary package kindly provided by EnterpriseDB":http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#osx
"Homebrew's":https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew Postgres installation also includes the contrib packages: @brew install postgres@

h2. Notes for Rails 3.1 and above

The master branch already support a custom serialization coder.
If you want to use it just put in your Gemfile:

@gem 'activerecord-postgres-hstore', git: 'git://github.com/softa/activerecord-postgres-hstore.git'@

If you install them gem from the master branch you also have to insert a line in each model that uses hstore.
Assuming a model called *Person*, with a *data* field on it, the code should look like:

bc. class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    serialize :data, ActiveRecord::Coders::Hstore
  end

h2. Install

Hstore is a PostgreSQL contrib type. Check it out first: "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/hstore.html":http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/hstore.html

Then, just add this to your Gemfile:

@gem 'activerecord-postgres-hstore'@

And run your bundler:

@bundle install@

Make sure that you have the desired database, if not create it as the desired user:

@createdb hstorage_dev@

Add the parameters to your database.yml (these are system dependant), e.g.:

bc. development:
  adapter: postgresql
  host: 127.0.0.1
  database: hstorage_dev
  encoding: unicode
  username: postgres
  password: 
  pool: 5

Now you need to create a migration that adds hstore support for your PostgreSQL database:

@rails g hstore:setup@

Run it:

@rake db:migrate@

Finally you can create your own tables using hstore type. It's easy:

@rails g model Person name:string data:hstore@
@rake db:migrate@

You're done.
Well, not yet. Don't forget to add indexes. Like this:

@CREATE INDEX people_gist_data ON people USING GIST(data);@
or
@CREATE INDEX people_gin_data ON people USING GIN(data);@

To understand the difference between the two types of indexes take a look at PostgreSQL docs: "http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/textsearch-indexes.html":http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/textsearch-indexes.html

h2. Usage

Once you have it installed, you just need to learn a little bit of new sqls for selecting stuff (creating and updating is transparent).
Find records that contains a key named 'foo':

@Person.where("data ? 'foo'")@

Find records where 'foo' is equal to 'bar':

@Person.where("data -> 'foo' = 'bar'")@

This same sql is at least twice as fast (using indexes) if you do it that way:

@Person.where("data @> 'foo=>bar'")@

Find records where 'foo' is not equal to 'bar':

@Person.where("data -> 'foo' <> 'bar'")@
or
@Person.where("not data @> 'foo=>bar'")@

Find records where 'foo' is like 'bar':

@Person.where("data -> 'foo' LIKE '%bar%'")@
or something like ...
@Person.where("data -> 'foo' ILIKE '%bar%'")@

If you need to delete a key in a record, you can do it that way:

@person.destroy_key(:data, :foo)@

This way you'll also save the record:

@person.destroy_key!(:data, :foo)@

The destroy_key method returns 'self', so you can chain it:

@person.destroy_key(:data, :foo).destroy_key(:data, :bar).save@

But there it a shortcut for that:

@person.destroy_keys(:data, :foo, :bar)@
or...
@person.destroy_keys!(:data, :foo, :bar)@

And finally, if you need to delete keys in many rows, you can:

@Person.delete_key(:data, :foo)@

and with many keys:

@Person.delete_keys(:data, :foo, :bar)@

Have fun.

h2. Help

You can use issues in github for that. Or else you can reach us at twitter: @dbiazus or @joaomilho

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
